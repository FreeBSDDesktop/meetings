# 2019-03-13: Agenda
 * DRM-legacy and current i386
 ** Fails with PAE. Need to update the wiki with the workaround to turn it off.
 * DRM kmod progress update
 ** Patches up on phabricator for Linux 5.0
 ** https://reviews.freebsd.org/D19565
 ** Also created a 4.16 / FreeBSD 13 branch of drm-kmod.
 ** These patches break drm-current-kmod, which need updating at the same time.
 ** Will try to figure out some way to ease the pain.
 ** V5.0 seem to solve amdgpu efi framebuffer problem (no need to disable syscons anymore).
 * Documentation
 ** Pete did a blog post on how to install the latest graphics stuff on to FreeBSD.
 ** Updating the blog post to docbook so we can add it to the handbook.
 * CI
 ** Nothing new. Niclas to ping FreeBSD CI team.
 * Meeting minutes
 ** Need to proof last two meetings.
 ** Once https://github.com/freebsd/meetings is up and running, we’ll publish there.
 * Quarterly report
 ** Niclas will create a new branch with the template so we can get a jump on next quarter’s report. Short OK, Pete will turn it into beautiful English.

 * Mesa - still in RC
 * Xserver 1.20.4 - still has issues with devd wrt autoconf, so build fails. Still root causing. 1.20.3 compiles great. Udev will fix this, but we need devd stuff for older releases.
