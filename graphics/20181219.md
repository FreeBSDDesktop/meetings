# 2018-12-19: Agenda
 * Release notes
 ** Done, looks good. They can be amended if needed.
 * Renaming drm-kmod and update versions
 ** FreeBSD current on 4.16, haven’t migrated to newer yet
 ** FreeBSD 12 uses 4.16 drivers (drm-fbsd12.0-kmod)
 ** FreeBSD 11 uses 4.11 drivers (drm-fbsd11.2-kmod) (they will also work on 12.0, but no promises about 12-stable branch)
 ** If we have to do more renaming, make sure we talk to re@ when we do this.
 ** For 12.1 we’ll either create a new port, or we’ll continue using the 12.0 port depending on the deltas between them.
 * Bumping llvm version in mesa
 ** Llvm 7. Pete has been running it w/o any issues.
 ** Niclas to coordinate with portmgr to see whether they want it in before or after the 2019Q1 branch.
 * Input stack
 ** Merging development branch into ports, some things still remaining
 ** Need to update ports (some to the latest version), once merging is done
 ** Nothing needs to be done in base for this round
 * Deorbit legacy drm in base
 ** Next stages planned for maybe Mid January. Be sure to coordinate with Matt, Michael and Manu. I’ll post a couple of reviews: one for dev/drm (which is a straight remove) and one for dev/drm2 which requires some nuance.
 * Sway
 ** Defer to next meeting
 * Other open times from prior meetings carried over until next year
 * Jan 2nd meeting works for everybody, except Warner. Will advise if we need to reschedule.
