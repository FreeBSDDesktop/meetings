# Meetings
Notes from meetings of various FreeBSD-related groups.

Several working groups in the FreeBSD project hold periodic meetings via
conference calls, video conferences, or other means.  This repository
aims to provide a central location to public public notes of those meetings.

Meeting notes are formatted in MarkDown.  Filenames should use a
*YYYYMMDD* prefix.
